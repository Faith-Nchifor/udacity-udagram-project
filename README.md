# Udacity's "Udagram" Project.
This project demonstrates the use of AWS ElasticbeansStalk to host a web application (an Image Filter application in this case).
The filteredImage route was created. This route accepts an image link and sends the filtered image.
The app was then build using npm run build and deployed to elasticbeanstalk using the following commands: 
    eb init
    eb create
    eb deploy
